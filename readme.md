# Isotope Package Manager

Isotope is a package manager designed to simplify the process of managing and distributing software packages. This repository contains the server component of Isotope, implemented in the Argon programming language.

## Deploy Your Own Isotope Server

We've made it incredibly easy to set up your own Isotope Server using Docker. If you want to have your own private instance of Isotope, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file from this repository.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Run the following command to start your Isotope Server:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

That's it! Your Isotope Server will be up and running, ready to manage and distribute software packages. Please note that there is already a public server available at https://isotope.wbell.dev/, but deploying your own server allows you to have complete control and privacy for your package management needs.
